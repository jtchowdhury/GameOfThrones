## Welcome to Game of Thrones
***(Inspired from the game "Chain Reaction" and the popular fiction "Game of Thrones")***\

Caution! *"When you play a game of thrones, you win or you die."* - George R.R. Martin 

(Spoiler) It can be as unpredictable as the actual fiction if you know how to play it.
The board is the representation of Westeros and each player represents a prominent house.
Your goal is to establish territories and expand them (by clicking in the cells) because according
to the author, *"The lone wolf dies but the pack survives."*


### Rules
- 2 to 7 players can play this game -- each will represent a house and go by turns.
- You can stack up to 3 flags in each cell except for the edge and corner cells, where you
    can stack up to 2 and 1 flag(s) respectively.
- You can't put your flag in other players' cells.
- After stacking 3 flags in a cell (2 and 1 for the edge and corner cells respectively) when you click
    there again, the cell explodes and take over the surrounding cells.
That's how you expand your territory. If the surrounding cells had others' flas,
    they'll become your territory now.
- If a certain house has no more territory remaining on the board, they're eliminated.
- The last player to survive the game wins the "Iron Throne" after all the other houses go extinct.
  
### Enjoy!
